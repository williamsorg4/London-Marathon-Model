# London Marathon Predictive Model

The London Marathon is one the most prestigious races in the world. As one of the Abbott World Marathon Majors, the London Marathon attracts over 50,000 runners to compete each year, along with approximately 750,000 spectators. Among the runners are some of the greatest elite distance runners in the world. Eliud Kipchoge, Mo Farah, Sifan Hassan, and the late Kelvin Kiptum have all raced the streets of London. Despite the marathons’s significance, it’s difficult to find statistically driven predictions for the race. Nearly every other sport has some sort of win probability model, but there is a void for runnning. In a sport that can witness extreme unpredictability, I believe it would be interesting and informative to build a model that predicts the winner and top finishers of the London Marathon. Given that the 2025 London Marathon will begin at 4:00 a.m. EST on April 27th, this project will focus on predicting the results of the 2025 race. I will then briefly evaluate the accuracy of the predictions after the race concludes. The full write up can be found [here](Project3.pdf).
